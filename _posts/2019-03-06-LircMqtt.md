title: Control a IR-Device with mqtt
---

Hello everyone, 
some weeks ago I wanted to integrate my television as well as my hifi in my smarthome system(I am using [FHEM](https://www.fhem.de/) for that). 
So first I installed [lirc](www.lirc.org) on my raspberrypi 3 (actually the model 3 is way to overpowerd for this purpose) and connected an infrared transmitter/receiver to it.

<!-- Picture of raspberry witch receiver and transmitter -->

The installation and setup of lirc was quite simple, I just had to follow these easy steps: [https://www.instructables.com/id/Raspberry-Pi-Zero-Universal-Remote/](https://www.instructables.com/id/Raspberry-Pi-Zero-Universal-Remote/). 

To controll lirc with mqtt-commands I adapted [this](https://www.instructables.com/id/Alexa-LIRC-Entertainment-Remote/) NodeJS-script:

Finally I added the mqtt-device to fhem and that's it.

Have a great a day!
